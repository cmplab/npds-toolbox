Welcome to NPDSâ€™s documentation!

NPDS  Toolbox  is  an  open-source  MATLAB  toolbox  for  implementing  phase distribution controls on different noise-free or noisy neural oscillator populations in order to desynchronize/synchronize them.  This toolbox has a graphical userinterface which is designed using GUIDE in MATLAB.  This toolbox is useful for researchers who want to study the theoretical aspects of neural  dynamics  ordesigning  distribution controls for neural populations. This Matlab toolbox currently has the the following capabilities:

- Simulating the controlling the neural oscillators synchronization by phase distribution controls without any programming efforts.
- Using the proportional control, bang-bang or user-defined control inputs.
- Defining the deterministic or stochastic neural oscillator populations with Gaussian white noise.
- Defining various phase response curves (PRC) related to different neuralmodels  such  as  Hodgkin-Huxley  (HH),  Fitzhugh-Nagumo  (FHN),  Rose-Hindmarsh (RH), and Thalamic.
- Investigating  the  dynamics  of  different  neural  models  such  as  Hodgkin-Huxley (HH), Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FHN), Rose-Hindmarsh (RH), and Thalamic.
- Defining the user-defined distributions or using well-known distributionssuch as Von-Mises or uniform ones for initial and final distributions.
- Possibility of using different numerical simulation approaches for simula-tions such as finite-difference, meshless, spectral, or Fourier decompositionmethods.
- Exporting the results as figures or matrices.
Synchronization plays a very significant role in brain functions such as perception, memory, neural information exchange, cognitive processing, and movement. On the other hand, excessive neuronal synchrony is one of the causes of the generation of epileptic seizures; thus, a fine balance between synchronization and desynchronization is functionally and behaviourally important. The phase distribution control approach is one of the suitable choices in order to make the analysis of high-dimensional systems such as neural dynamics more convenient and makes the designing of the control systems experimentally more applicable. This toolbox is designed so that researchers can investigate the theories of dynamics and synchronization of neural models without any knowledge of programming and scientific computing.
