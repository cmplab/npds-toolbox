NPDS  Toolbox  is  an  open-source  MATLAB  toolbox  for  implementing  **phase distribution controls on different noise-free or noisy neural oscillator populations in order to desynchronize/synchronize them**. This toolbox has a graphical userinterface which is designed using *GUIDE* in MATLAB.  This toolbox is useful for researchers who want to study the theoretical aspects of neural  dynamics  or designing  distribution controls for neural populations.
